This paper’s goal is to understand the haptic-visual congruency perception of skin-slip on the fngertips given visual cues in Vir- tual Reality (VR). We developed SpinOcchio (Spin for the spinning mechanism used, Occhio for the Italian word “eye”), a handheld haptic controller capable of rendering the thickness and slipping of a virtual object pinched between two fngers. This is achieved using a mechanism with spinning and pivoting disks that apply a tangential skin-slip movement to the fngertips. With SpinOcchio, we determined the baseline haptic discrimination threshold for skin-slip, and, using these results, we tested how haptic realism of motion and thickness is perceived with varying visual cues in VR. Surprisingly, the results show that in all cases, visual cues dominate over haptic perception. Based on these results, we suggest appli- cations that leverage skin-slip and grip interaction, contributing further to realistic experiences in VR.
