Various haptic feedback techniques have been explored to enable users to interact with their virtual surroundings using their hands. However, investigation on interactions with virtual objects slipping against the skin using skin-slip haptic feedback is still at its early stages. Prior skin-slip virtual reality (VR) haptic display implementations involved bulky actuation mechanisms and were not suitable for multi-finger and bimanual interactions. As a solution to this limitation, we present SpinOcchietto, a wearable skin-slip haptic feedback device using spinning discs for rendering the width and movement of virtual objects gripped between the fingertips. SpinOcchietto was developed to miniaturize and simplify SpinOcchio, a 6-DoF handheld skin-slip haptic display. With its smaller, lighter, and wearable form factor, SpinOcchietto enables users with a wide range of hand sizes to interact with virtual objects with their thumb and index fingers while freeing the rest of the hand. Users can perceive the speed of virtual objects slipping against the fingertips and can use varying grip strengths to grab and release the objects. Three demo applications were developed to showcase the different types of virtual object interactions enabled by the prototype.
