## For prospective Ph.D. students

We are always looking for passionate students interested in our Ph.D. program and eager to work on topics such as **interactive systems and digital fabrication**. Ideal candidates should have some **prior research experience** (preferable in the field of HCI) and **proven technical capabilities** in designing or building interactive systems (e.g., programming, electronics, mechanical design and fabrication, user studies).

We encourage students from a _variety of majors_ to apply. Current and past lab members came from diverse fields such as **design, art, business, architecture, computer science, and mechanical engineering**. 

Students are encouraged to apply by initially sending directly an <a href="#" onclick="(function(){window.open('mailto:andrea@kaist.ac.kr');})()">email <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a> to professor Bianchi expressing the intention to formally apply. In your email include links to your personal website, examples of code from your repositories (e.g., a link to GitHub), titles of publications, or any other information that could help us see your potential as a researcher. Apply through [this link](https://admission.kaist.ac.kr).

## For Master's program applicants

ID KAIST offers a **fully-funded** Master's program. The program is **research-oriented**, which means that on top of your coursework you are expected to conduct research. Master's applicants are assigned to labs **after** they have been granted admission to the department. If you are interested in our Master's program, please go ahead and apply [here](https://admission.kaist.ac.kr).


## Tips for your application

- Include **specific reasons** why you want to apply to our department and lab.
- Include material that **demonstrates your technical artistic capabilities**: this includes source code of projects, images or videos or prototypes, a personal website, previous research papers, videos you made, etc...
- Make sure to take a **look at our previous research** projects: which project do you like and why? How do you suggest contributing to our lab?

### Admission process

For the application process, please refer to the [KAIST admission site](https://admission.kaist.ac.kr).

Labs cannot directly accept students. Instead, students interested in our graduate programs should apply to the department and indicate in which lab they would like to work (optional in the case of a Master's application). A committee composed of all the professors will judge each candidate and grant or deny admission through the reviewing process. Admitted graduate students receive a basic scholarship from KAIST and a salary from the lab, depending on the availability of projects and student involvement (minimum salary is guaranteed by law). For further questions please refer to these lists of Q&A for the [Master](http://id.kaist.ac.kr/index.php?mid=masterp#) and [Ph.D.](http://id.kaist.ac.kr/index.php?mid=phdp) programs.

### For international applicants (Master's or Ph.D.)

- Like domestic candidates, international students are also **fully-funded**.
- **English** is the official language used for courses and research. Knowing some Korean might help, but it is not necessary.

## For perspective internships

If you are currently registered as a KAIST student (including a visiting student) and are interested in an internship in our lab or in starting a URP (Undergraduate Research Program) under the supervision of professor Bianchi, please contact him directly via <a href="#" onclick="(function(){window.open('mailto:andrea@kaist.ac.kr');})()">email <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a>.

Our lab welcomes visiting researchers from other institutions in Korea or abroad with a similar research interest to ours. However, **we only consider applicants recommended by colleagues or peers in the HCI field**. We also only consider international applicants that can commit to staying for **at least 6 months**. If you are a foreigner, you also need to obtain a valid VISA through our school's [Visiting Research Program](https://io.kaist.ac.kr/menu/io.do?mguid=D4CD2D0A-21E5-E511-940C-2C44FD7DF8B9). For further information, please contact [KAIST International Office](https://io.kaist.ac.kr/).
