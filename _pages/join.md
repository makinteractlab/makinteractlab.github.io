## TL;DR

- We are **looking for grad students** interested in interactive systems, VR, haptics and robots, digital fabrication, etc...
- MS and Ph.D. students are **fully funded** and receive a government scholarship plus a lab stipend
- MS is **2** years, Ph.D. is **4**. MS+PhD combined is **5** years
- All programs are in **English**
- For PhD, I expect some prior research **experience** and some proven technical **capabilities** (e.g., coding, making, stats, research methods...)
- OK with many majors of origin - not a disadvantage or advance per se. OK no prior design background
- For **internship** we welcome KAIST students and consider applicants from elsewhere with strong recommendations
- For inquiries reach out directly via <a href="#" onclick="(function(){window.open('mailto:andrea@kaist.ac.kr');})()">email <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a> or the [contact form](./contact.md)

## For prospective Ph.D. students

We are always looking for passionate students interested in our Ph.D. program in the Department of Industrial Design at KAIST (ID KAIST), and eager to work on topics such as **interactive systems and digital fabrication**. The Ph.D. program at KAIST is **fully-funded** and it typically ranges between 3-5 years, with 4 years being the typical length of the program. In the first two years, you will focus on coursework and passing a qualifying exam, while also starting your dive into research. In the last two years, you will work on publications and on preparing your dissertation.

Ideal candidates for the Ph.D. program should have some **prior research experience** (preferably in the field of HCI) and **proven technical capabilities** in designing or building interactive systems (e.g., programming, electronics, mechanical design, fabrication, user studies). We encourage students from a _variety of majors_ to apply. Current and past lab members came from diverse fields such as **design, art, business, architecture, computer science, and mechanical engineering**.

Students are encouraged to apply by initially sending an <a href="#" onclick="(function(){window.open('mailto:andrea@kaist.ac.kr');})()">email <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a> directly to professor Bianchi expressing the intention to formally apply. In your email include links to your personal website, examples of code from your repositories (e.g., a link to GitHub), titles of publications, or any other information that could help us see your potential as a researcher. Finally, hand in your applications using [the KAIST admission system](https://admission.kaist.ac.kr).

## For Master's program applicants

MAKinteract lan in the department of Industrial Design at KAIST (ID KAIST) offers a **fully-funded** Master's opening position **every** _spring_ and _fall_ semesters. The MS program is **research-oriented**, which means that on top of your coursework, you are expected to conduct research. The Master's program lasts two years. We also offer a **Masters+Ph.D. combined** program. The way it works is that you would apply to the MS program first, and then during your first semester you internally apply to move to the Ph.D. track.

Strong candidates are encouraged to contact directly the lab. If you are interested in our Master's program, please go ahead and apply [here](https://admission.kaist.ac.kr).

## Tips for your application

- Include **specific reasons** why you want to apply to our department and the MAKinteract lab.
- Include material that **demonstrates your technical, analytical, or artistic capabilities**: this includes source code of projects, images or videos or prototypes, a personal website, previous research papers, videos you made, etc...
- Make sure to take a **look at our previous research** projects: which project do you like and why? How do you suggest contributing to our lab?

### Admission process

For the application process, please refer to the [KAIST admission site](https://admission.kaist.ac.kr).

Labs cannot directly accept students. Instead, students interested in our graduate programs should apply to KAIST and indicate in which department and lab (_Professor Andrea Bianchi's MAKinteract Lab_) they would like to work. A committee composed of all the professors will judge each candidate and grant or deny admission through the reviewing process. Admitted graduate students receive a basic scholarship from KAIST and a stipend from the lab, depending on the availability of projects and student involvement (a minimum national stipend is anyway always guaranteed by law). For further questions please refer to this list of [Q&As](https://id.kaist.ac.kr/index.php?mid=FAQ).

### For international applicants (Master's or Ph.D.)

- Like domestic candidates, international students are also **fully-funded**.
- **English** is the official language used for courses and research. Knowing some Korean might help, but it is not necessary.

## For perspective internships

If you are currently registered as a KAIST student (including a visiting student) and are interested in an internship in our lab or in starting a URP (Undergraduate Research Program) under the supervision of Professor Bianchi, please contact him directly via <a href="#" onclick="(function(){window.open('mailto:andrea@kaist.ac.kr');})()">email <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a>.

Our lab welcomes visiting researchers from other institutions in Korea or abroad with a similar research interest to ours. However, **we only consider applicants recommended by colleagues or peers in the HCI field**. We also only consider international applicants that can commit to staying for **at least 6 months**. If you are a foreigner, you also need to obtain a valid VISA through our school's [Visiting Research Program](https://io.kaist.ac.kr/menu/io.do?mguid=D4CD2D0A-21E5-E511-940C-2C44FD7DF8B9). For further information, please contact [KAIST International Office](https://io.kaist.ac.kr/).
